# AtliQ-Telecom-domain-Dashboard
<p>This dashboard is created as part of the code basic resume challenge.</p>
<p>Live dashboard link: https://project.novypro.com/bfnjDa</p>

<p>Domain: Telecom</p>    <p>Function: Executive Management</p>

<p><b>Situation:</b></p>
<p>AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.</p>
<p>However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch.</p>
<p>The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics.</p>

<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>1. Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has a minimal idea about dashboarding.</p> 
<p>2. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.</p>
<p>3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b></p>
<p>1. Import data in power bi and perform data cleaning in Power Query.</p>
<p>2. Develop key metrics like total revenue, total active users, and total unsubscribed users.</p>
<p>3. Segment users based on demographics, location, or usage behaviour to identify specific groups experiencing changes in usage patterns post-5G.</p>
<p>4. Develop visualizations in line with the mock-up dashboard provided by stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Result:</b></p>
<p>1. Enhanced understanding of market dynamics and customer preferences.</p>
<p>2. Improved revenue management strategies.</p>
<p>3. Increased operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making</p>.
